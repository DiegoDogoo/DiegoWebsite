This is the repository for my website that will act as a portfolio for many projects and opportunities to come.

Googler Jessica Xu provided the base template during my time at the 2024 Google Tech Exchange Finale, where 
I was also granted a domain under the 'Domains for Devs' program at Google. 

Currently, the website does not hold much, as this is my first experience with both Github repositories and 
website development, but it is something I look forward to adding to my skill set.

I am hoping for this website to be something a little more personal rather than professional, but I still 
hope that this will serve as a strong introduction to my skills as a developer.

The website is up and running at diego-garcia.dev for all interested.
